## 100-Day Coding Plan for Mastering Data Structures and Algorithms

### Day -∞ to 0:
- Stick to a programming language like C or Java , C++. Ensure comfort with pointers/objects.

### Day 1:
- Understand the concept of Algorithmic complexity. Derive time and space complexity for code.

### Day 2 - 10:
- Learn simple data structures:
  - Arrays
  - Linked Lists
  - Strings
  - Stacks
  - Queues
- Understand basic operations (insert, delete, search, traversal) and their Big-O complexity.

### Day 11 - 25:
- Learn simple algorithms:
  - Sorting: Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap, Bucket, Counting, Radix, External sorting
  - Search: Linear, Binary
  - Prime Numbers: Sieve of Eratosthenes, Primality test
  - Strings: String searching, LCS, Palindrome detection
  - Miscellaneous: Euclidean algorithm, Matrix multiplication, Fibonacci Numbers, Pascal's Triangle, Max Subarray

### Day 26 - 50:
- Solve problems from:
  - Cracking the Coding Interview
  - Elements of Programming Interviews
  - Programming Interviews Exposed
  - GeeksforGeeks
  - HackerRank
  - InterviewBit
- Focus on arrays, linked lists, strings, stacks, queues, and complexity.

### Day 51 - 60:
- Learn non-linear data structures:
  - Tree: Binary, Binary Search Tree
  - Heaps
  - Hash table
  - Graph: Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Topological sorting, Minimum spanning tree, Shortest path

### Day 61 - 90:
- Continue solving problems from trees, hash tables, heaps, and graphs.

### Day 91 - 100:
- Understand Computational complexity theory and NP-completeness.
- Solve problems like Knapsack problem, Travelling salesman problem, SAT problem, etc.

### Day 101 - ∞:
- Revise topics and start competitive programming.
- Good luck!
